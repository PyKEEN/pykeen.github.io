PyKEEN (**Py**thon **K**nowl**E**dge **E**mbeddi**N**gs) is a Python package designed to train and
evaluate knowledge graph embedding models (incorporating multi-modal information)

## Benchmarking Study

<img src="/img/fb15k237.png" alt="FB15k237 Summary" />

We've run an unprecedented large benchmarking study. This image describes the results
on the FB15k237 dataset across several knowledge graph embedding models, loss functions,
training approaches, and usages of explicit modeling of inverse triples. This is just one
of several datasets analyzed in this study. In our manuscript, we also assess the reproducibility
of old models' best reported hyperparameters.
