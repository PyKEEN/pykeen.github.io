The expression of each gene is often measured in groups of patients with a given
disease to compare to healthy patients. It is then calculated which genes are
higher, lower, or similar to healthy patients. We've used these calculations
to introduce patients into a biomedical knowledge graph containing genes
so we could generate an embedding for each patient using PyKEEN. After,
we showed these embeddings are useful for classifying new patients and other
downstream ML tasks.
